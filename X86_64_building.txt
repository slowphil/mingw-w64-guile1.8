X86_64_building.txt

Guile 1.8.8 builds fine for X86_64 on any linux distribution provided warnings are not considered as errors.

On the contrary, in Mingw-w64 building fails because on this platform the lengths of long and pointers differ, which causes errors in several files. I've made a quick-and-dirty patch to address these errors (I did not really take the time to think whether what I was doing was the completely appropriate thing to do). However, when applying this patch guile.exe builds, but it does not run: I must have screwed something in the patch.

Another way to remove compilation errors is to use configure the option --without-64-calls (and not the above patch), but the result is similar : guile.exe does not run.
